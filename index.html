MathArt is a series of C++ scripts I wrote for rendering mathematical functions to create art. It is high performance and multithreaded, and supports various types of 2d as well as 3d functions and stochastic/dynamical systems. It is also designed to be easy to use, as it can automatically color in scenes to make them look interesting.

<h2>Mandelbrot/Iterative Divergence</h2>

The mandelbrot set is the subset of the complex numbers given by

\[ \{ c \in \mathbb{C} : |f_c(0)|,|f_c^2(0)|,... \text{ is bounded} \}, \quad f_c(z)=z^2+c \]

In fact, you can create mandelbrot variants with other functions such as

\[ f_c(z)=z \cos(z)+c \]
